/**
 * Represents a single atomic model change within a semantic changelog JSON entry.
 *
 * <p>Each entry corresponds to one EMF {@code EChange} and captures enough information to:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Understand the change without EMF knowledge (via {@link #changeType} and
 *       {@link #changeDescription}).</li>
 *   <li>Replay or reverse the change (via {@link #elementUuid}, {@link #feature},
 *       {@link #from}, {@link #to}).</li>
 *   <li>Detect semantic conflicts during branch merges (via {@link #elementUuid} and
 *       {@link #feature}).</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Conflict detection key: two entries from different branches conflict when their
 * {@code elementUuid} and {@code feature} values match and the change types indicate
 * incompatible operations (see {@link SemanticChangeType} javadoc for severity guidance).
 *
 * <p>Fields that are not applicable for a given change type are {@code null}.
 * For example, {@code feature} is {@code null} for {@link SemanticChangeType#ELEMENT_CREATED}
 * and {@link SemanticChangeType#ELEMENT_DELETED}, and {@code referencedElementUuid} is only
 * set for reference changes.
